# discord-sentiment-scraper
## This is a simple program to scape sentiment data from discord.

This program uses the discord and textblob libraries. The discord library is used to connect to a Discord server and listen for messages, while the textblob library is used to calculate the sentiment of messages.

To use this program, you will need to replace YOUR_DISCORD_BOT_TOKEN_HERE with your own Discord bot token. You can learn how to create a Discord bot and get its token here.

This program will print the sentiment of each message that is sent on the Discord server. The sentiment is a value between -1 and 1, where -1 represents very negative sentiment and 1 represents very positive sentiment.
